# 95sHardcoreMinecraftServer
A project to create a great Hardcore minecraft server, "Revive | Semi-Anarchy | Lobby". It will have a revival mod, which will give you a limited time to revive someone when they die, it will not ban when you die, you will go to a lobby instead, and it will be semi-anarchy (read the README file to find out what admins can and can't do, as well as extra info.)
