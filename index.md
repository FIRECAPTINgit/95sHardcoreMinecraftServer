## Info
Here is some info regarding 95s Hardcore for your conveince.

### Revive | Semi-Anarchy | Lobby
This server will have a way of making the server more conveinet. Allowing for more fun.
#### Revive
Tired of dieing? Well, in this minecraft server, it would benefit greatly to start a group. Then, if one of your group members dies, you will have a limited time to revive them. Or if you don't feel like being in a group, then you can always press the 'Accept Fate' button to drop the time left to revive to 0.

#### Semi-Anarchy
I see a 'Semi-Anarchy' experience much better than a full-on anarchy experience. Contray to popular belif, because of the fact that full anarchy servers have no rules, that means that you can be banned for no reason. So, this hardcore server is doing something differant, so I present, **Semi-Anarchy**.
##### What admins can't do
Admins on this server can't do the following.
* <span style="color:red"> Ban you for no reason</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Play in creative</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Attack you randomly while moderating the server</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Kick you for no reason</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use xray resource packs</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use hack clients</span>
