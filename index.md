## Welcome to Windows 95 Experience's Hardcore Minecraft Server.



## Info
Here is some info regarding 95s Hardcore for your conveince.

### Revive | Semi-Anarchy | Lobby
This server will have a way of making the server more conveinet. Allowing for more fun.
#### Revive
Tired of dieing? Well, in this minecraft server, it would benefit greatly to start a group. Then, if one of your group members dies, you will have a limited time to revive them. Or if you don't feel like being in a group, then you can always press the 'Accept Fate' button to drop the time left to revive to 0.

#### Semi-Anarchy
I see a 'Semi-Anarchy' experience much better than a full-on anarchy experience. Contray to popular belif, because of the fact that full anarchy servers have no rules, that means that you can be banned for no reason. So, this hardcore server is doing something differant, so I present, **Semi-Anarchy**.
##### What admins can't do
Admins on this server can't do the following.
* <span style="color:red"> Ban you for no reason</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Play in creative</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Attack you randomly while moderating the server</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Kick you for no reason</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use xray resource packs</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use hack clients</span>
##### What players can't do
Players on this server can't do the following.
* <span style="color:red"> Kill other players on sight (KOS)
* <span style="color:red"> Convince a friend who is an admin to give you admin</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Break [Mojang's EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula)</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Bribe admins</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use xray resource packs</span>
* <span style="color:red"> Use hack clients</span>

### Lobby
Unlike other hardcore servers, this server doesn't temporaryliy ban you when you die. Instead, you get teleported to a lobby where there will be a lounge, observation area (which will include a button to change between Spectator and Adventure), and a mini-game arena. Currently, I plan to have everyone teleported back to the map after each day (Except for saturdays).
